I just really, really really wanted a heavily Canadianized coin :)

This is basically a Litecoin fork that was mostly rebranded (windows installer wasn't)

Binaries are @ https://svn.jmbg.net/canuckcoin/tags

So far was able to make this work on FreeBSD, Linux and Windows (64bit) and a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian

Also note I posted this on github. I have no idea how to use git (haven't used it much and forgot) so muddling through.

WIP
